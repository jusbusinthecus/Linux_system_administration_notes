To use Kickstart you must:

Choose a kickstart server and create/edit a kickstart file
Make the kickstart file available on a network location
Make the installation source available
Make boot media available for client which will be used to begin the installation
start the kickstart installation

You can use either: NFS, FTP, HTTP or HTTPS, for this example http will be used. 

When logging in as root home directory there is a anaconda kickstart file that you can modify or create a fresh one:


#Beginning of kickstart file for installing
#version=RHEL9
install
lang en_US.UTF-8
keyboard us
network --bootproto=dhcp --hostname=your.hostname.com
rootpw --iscrypted # to create a hashed password run this on a rhel command "openssl passwd -6 your_password_here" and add to this line.
timezone America/New_York --isUtc
user --name=your_username --password=your_hashed_password_here --gecos="Your Name" --groups=wheel

# Partitioning
autopart --type=lvm

# System services
services --enabled="sshd"

# Package selection
%packages
@^minimal
@^web-server
@^container-tools
wget
curl
vim
git
%end

# Post-installation script
%post
echo "Post-installation script running"
# Add any additional configuration commands here
%end

Once you finish with the file ensure httpd is installed and enabled --now, then copy the kick start file to /var/www/html, change permissions to
make it readable, verify you can reach the page from another computer.
- dnf install http -y
- systemctl enable --now httpd
- cp <kickstart_file> /var/www/html
- curl http://<path_to_file> # may not be necessary
- chmod a+r <path_to_file>

Once you're done with the file to  this go to your Virtual environment and setup the parameters and create the VM template.
Start the VM with the attached iso, and interupt the start screen and press 'esc'. This should take you to a screen that says 'boot:' 
with a command prompt ready to receive input.

syntax:

- linux ks=http//<IP>/<path_to_file> #remember in this example were are using http connection
