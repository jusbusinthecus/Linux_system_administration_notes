Check rule for firewall = firewall-cmd --list-all

get list of all services firewalld is aware of = firewall-cmd --get-services

firewalld has multiple zones, to get a list of zones = firewall-cmd --get-zones

For active zones = firewall-cmd --get-active-zones # public is commonly used.

to get a specific zone = firewall-cmd --zone=<zone> --list-all

adding a service to firewall rules = firewall-cmd --add-service=http # of course you want to make sure the httpd service is running.
Remove service - firewall-cmd --remove-service=http

reloading changes = firewall-cmd --reload

permament changes = firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http  # same with remove


To add a service that is not predefined by firewalld service
- ll /usr/lib/firewalld/services/
Copy any xml file and change the service and port number. In this example sap is being used which is port 32
- cp /usr/lib/firewalld/services/ssh.xml sap.xml
- vim sap.xml # replace short description with SAP and replace description with something arbiturary and lastly change the port number to 32 or other applicable port 
# number

  <description>Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for logging into and executing commands on remote machines. It provides secure encrypted communications. If you plan on accessing your machine remotely via SSH over a firewalled interface, enable this option. You need the openssh-server package installed for this option to be useful.</description>
